## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

I learn't how to make a line using psuedo element(::after)


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```<div>
  <svg>
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: Cyan;
    color: blue;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
I want focus more on css grid and flexbox because it greatly contribute to designing any web sites
